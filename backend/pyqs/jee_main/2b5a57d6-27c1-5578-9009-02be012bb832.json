Let's examine each option one by one:</p>\n\n<p>Option A: Rusting of iron is envisaged as setting up of an electrochemical cell on the surface of iron object. This statement is correct. Rusting of iron is an electrochemical process that occurs when iron (Fe) reacts with water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, which we commonly know as rust. Iron acts as the anode, the part where oxidation occurs as iron loses electrons. Oxygen, often dissolved in water, acts as the cathode where reduction occurs, completing the electrochemical cell.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: Dissolved acidic oxides such as $$\\mathrm{SO}_2$$ and $$\\mathrm{NO}_2$$ in water act as catalyst in the process of rusting. This statement is correct. Acidic oxides like $$\\mathrm{SO}_2$$ and $$\\mathrm{NO}_2$$ can dissolve in water to form acidic solutions which can lead to the acceleration of the rate of rusting as they may lower the pH of water, thereby increasing the availability of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) which may facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in rusting.</p>\n\n<p>Option C: Coating of iron surface by tin prevents rusting, even if the tin coating is peeling off. This statement is incorrect. Tin (Sn) is used as a protective coating for iron to prevent it from rusting; however, if the tin coating starts to peel off, it exposes the iron underneath to the atmosphere, which will then be susceptible to rusting. Once the protective layer is compromised, the iron is at risk, especially if the exposed parts are more anodic than tin. Tin as a more cathodic metal can even act to accelerate the corrosion of the exposed iron—this is known as a bimetallic corrosion or galvanic corrosion.</p>\n\n<p>Option D: When $$\\mathrm{pH}$$ lies above 9 or 10, rusting of iron does not take place. This statement is generally correct. Rusting of iron is lessened in alkaline conditions, i.e., when the pH is above 9 or 10 because the increased availability of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) can reduce the solubility of iron(II) and iron(III) ions, leading to their precipitation as hydroxides rather than participating in the rusting process.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the statement from the given options that is not correct about the rusting of iron is Option C, which falsely claims that a peeling tin surface can still prevent rusting of iron.</p>"},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscrqpvw","chapter":"redox-reactions","chapterGroup":"physical-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>Which of the following cannot function as an oxidising agent?</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"$$\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$$\n"},{"identifier":"B","content":"$$\\mathrm{MnO}_4^{-}$$\n"},{"identifier":"C","content":"$$\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$$\n"},{"identifier":"D","content":"$$\\mathrm{BrO}_3^{-}$$"}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":"<p>The ability of a species to function as an oxidizing agent depends on its ability to gain electrons (be reduced). For a species to be an oxidizing agent, it must contain an element that has a positive oxidation state and is capable of being reduced (gain electrons), thereby oxidizing another species.</p>\n\n<p>Let's look at each of the options :</p>\n\n<p>Option A: $$\\mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}$$ (sulfate ion) has sulfur in a +6 oxidation state. Sulfate is the fully oxidized form of sulfur in aqueous solution, and while it can undergo certain reductions under specific conditions (to form, for example, $\\mathrm{SO}_3^{2-}$ or sulfite), it is generally stable and not commonly considered a strong oxidizing agent.</p>\n\n<p>Option B: $$\\mathrm{MnO}_4^{-}$$ (permanganate ion) has manganese in a +7 oxidation state. This ion is a very strong oxidizing agent and is well known for its ability to oxidize a wide range of organic and inorganic substances, with manganese being reduced to a lower oxidation state (often to +2 as $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ in acidic solution).</p>\n\n<p>Option C: $$\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$$ is the nitride ion, with nitrogen in a -3 oxidation state. Since nitrogen is in its lowest oxidation state, it cannot be further reduced (gain more electrons), and hence cannot act as an oxidizing agent. In fact, it would more likely act as a reducing agent because it has room to be oxidized (lose electrons).</p>\n\n<p>Option D: $$\\mathrm{BrO}_3^{-}$$ (bromate ion) has bromine in a +5 oxidation state. This ion can act as an oxidizing agent because the bromine can be reduced to a lower oxidation state (often to -1 as $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the species that cannot function as an oxidizing agent due to its inability to undergo reduction is Option C, the $$\\mathrm{N}^{3-}$$ ion.</p>"},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscrt1vb","chapter":"d-and-f-block-elements","chapterGroup":"inorganic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>Given below are two statements :</p>\n<p>Statement (I) : In the Lanthanoids, the formation $$\\mathrm{Ce}^{+4}$$ is favoured by its noble gas configuration.</p>\n<p>Statement (II) : $$\\mathrm{Ce}^{+4}$$ is a strong oxidant reverting to the common +3 state.</p>\n<p>In the light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options given below :</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"Both Statement I and Statement II are false\n"},{"identifier":"B","content":"Statement I is true but Statement II is false\n"},{"identifier":"C","content":"Both Statement I and Statement II are true\n"},{"identifier":"D","content":"Statement I is false but Statement II is true"}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscruebh","chapter":"d-and-f-block-elements","chapterGroup":"inorganic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>Choose the correct option having all the elements with $$\\mathrm{d}^{10}$$ electronic configuration from the following :</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"$${ }^{46} \\mathrm{Pd},{ }^{28} \\mathrm{Ni},{ }^{26} \\mathrm{Fe},{ }^{24} \\mathrm{Cr}$$\n"},{"identifier":"B","content":"$${ }^{29} \\mathrm{Cu},{ }^{30} \\mathrm{Zn},{ }^{48} \\mathrm{Cd},{ }^{47} \\mathrm{Ag}$$\n"},{"identifier":"C","content":"$${ }^{27} \\mathrm{Co},{ }^{28} \\mathrm{Ni},{ }^{26} \\mathrm{Fe},{ }^{24} \\mathrm{Cr}$$\n"},{"identifier":"D","content":"$${ }^{28} \\mathrm{Ni},{ }^{24} \\mathrm{Cr},{ }^{26} \\mathrm{Fe},{ }^{29} \\mathrm{Cu}$$"}],"correct_options":["B"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscrvirz","chapter":"basics-of-organic-chemistry","chapterGroup":"organic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>The incorrect statement regarding conformations of ethane is :</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"The dihedral angle in staggered conformation is $$60^{\\circ}$$.\n"},{"identifier":"B","content":"Ethane has infinite number of conformations.\n"},{"identifier":"C","content":"Eclipsed conformation is the most stable conformation.\n"},{"identifier":"D","content":"The conformations of ethane are inter-convertible to one-another."}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscrx897","chapter":"hydrocarbons","chapterGroup":"organic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>The final product A, formed in the following reaction sequence is:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/fly/@width/image/6y3zli1lsd354zi/a9eedbd2-9454-49e3-acd9-0641e32853eb/274b69e0-c66e-11ee-9e75-ed145f26bf63/file-6y3zli1lsd354zj.png?format=png\" data-orsrc=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/image/6y3zli1lsd354zi/a9eedbd2-9454-49e3-acd9-0641e32853eb/274b69e0-c66e-11ee-9e75-ed145f26bf63/file-6y3zli1lsd354zj.png\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"max-width: 100%;height: auto;display: block;margin: 0 auto;max-height: 40vh;vertical-align: baseline\" alt=\"JEE Main 2024 (Online) 27th January Evening Shift Chemistry -

Atoms or ions with a noble gas configuration have completely filled electron shells, similar to the electron configuration of the noble gases, which are the elements found in Group 18 of the periodic table.

Positive zero error refers to the condition when the zero mark on the Vernier scale is to the right of the zero mark on the main scale when the jaws of the caliper are completely closed. In this case, even when measuring a zero length, the Vernier caliper will show a positive reading, indicating an error.

So, Assertion (A) is true.</p>\n\n<p>Reason (R) explains the possible causes of zero error in Vernier calipers. Zero errors can indeed occur due to imperfect manufacturing processes, where the scales are not perfectly aligned.

Elasticity is a physical property of a material whereby it can restore it to its original shape or size after deformation (stretching, compressing, or twisting) provided the deformation is within the material's elastic limit. Once the external force is removed, an elastic material will return to its initial state due to its intrinsic property. So, we can affirm the validity of Assertion (A).</p>\n\n<p>The statement labelled as Reason (R) is also true. When a material is deformed due to an applied external force, the molecules within the material are displaced from their equilibrium positions. The intermolecular and interatomic forces create a restoring force that attempts to bring the molecules back to their original, or equilibrium, positions. This restoring force is what allows the material to regain its shape when the external force is removed, assuming the material has not been deformed beyond its elastic limit.

This statement is true because by definition, an equipotential surface is a surface over which the electric potential is constant. When a charge moves along an equipotential surface, there is no change in its electric potential energy since potential difference $$ \\Delta V $$ is zero.

Hence, the Assertion (A) is correct.</p>\n<p>Reason (R) says that electric lines of forces are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces. This statement is also correct as the electric field lines, by definition, are directed such that they are tangent to the electric field vector at any point in space. Since the electric potential is constant on an equipotential surface, there can be no component of the electric field parallel to the surface, as that would imply a force and potential change along the surface. The electric field thus must be perpendicular to the equipotential surface, which means that the electric field lines must also be perpendicular to the equipotential surface. In other words, the electric field does no work when a charge moves along an equipotential surface because the motion is perpendicular to the force.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Reason (R) is not only correct, but it is also the correct explanation for Assertion (A), making Option A the right choice.</p>\n"},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscpjas0","chapter":"wave-optics","chapterGroup":"optics","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"physics","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>When a polaroid sheet is rotated between two crossed polaroids then the transmitted light intensity will be maximum for a rotation of :</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"$$90^\\circ$$"},{"identifier":"B","content":"$$30^\\circ$$"},{"identifier":"C","content":"$$45^\\circ$$"},{"identifier":"D","content":"$$60^\\circ$$"}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"jaoe38c1lscpkphx","chapter":"electromagnetic-waves","chapterGroup":"electricity","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"physics","subjectGroup":null,"topic":null,"type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>An object is placed in a medium of refractive index 3 .
