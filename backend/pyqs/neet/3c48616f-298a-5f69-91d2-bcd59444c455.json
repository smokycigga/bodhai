It&#39;s a permanent effect.</li>\n<br/><li>The electromeric effect is a temporary effect, occurring when a reagent approaches a double bond or a polar molecule and causes electrons to shift entirely from one atom to another.</li>\n<br/><li>Generally, in organic chemistry, the inductive effect is considered to be a weaker effect compared to the electromeric effect. When both effects are present and oppose each other, the electromeric effect, being a more dominant electronic effect, usually prevails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Statement II : &quot;Hyperconjugation is observed in o-xylene.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hyperconjugation is a phenomenon where electrons in a sigma bond (usually C-H or C-C) are delocalized into an adjacent empty or partially filled p-orbital or pi-orbital, stabilizing the system.</li>\n<br/><li>o-Xylene is an aromatic compound with two methyl groups attached to the benzene ring in ortho positions. However, hyperconjugation typically occurs in alkenes or carbocations where there is an adjacent p-orbital. In o-xylene, the aromatic system is already stabilized by resonance, and the hyperconjugation of the methyl groups does not significantly contribute to this stability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on these explanations :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Statement I is false because the electromeric effect is generally stronger than the inductive effect.</li>\n<li>Statement II is true as hyperconjugation can be observed in o-xylene, although its impact on the molecule&#39;s stability is minimal compared to the aromatic resonance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, the correct option is :\n<br/><br/>Option B : Statement-I is false but Statement-II is true.</p>"},{"question_id":"1linb8lyd","chapter":"redox-reactions","chapterGroup":"physical-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":"oxidation-and-reduction-reactions","type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>The correct option for a redox couple is:</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"Both are oxidised forms involving same element."},{"identifier":"B","content":"Both are reduced forms involving same element."},{"identifier":"C","content":"Both the reduced and oxidised forms involve same element."},{"identifier":"D","content":"Cathode and anode together."}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":"<p>Redox couple is both the reduced and oxidised form involve same element.</p>"},{"question_id":"1linbc3q4","chapter":"d-and-f-block-elements","chapterGroup":"inorganic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":"inner-transition-elements-lanthanoids-and-actinoids","type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>Given below are two statements : one is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is labelled as Reason (R).</p>\n<p>Assertion (A) : Ionisation enthalpies of early actinoids are lower than for early lanthanoids.</p>\n<p>Reason (R) : Electrons are entering 5f orbitals in actinoids which experience greater shielding from nuclear charge.</p>\n<p>In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below :</p>","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"(A) is true but (R) is false."},{"identifier":"B","content":"(A) is false but (R) is true."},{"identifier":"C","content":"Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)."},{"identifier":"D","content":"Both (A) and (R) are true but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A)."}],"correct_options":["C"],"answer":null,"explanation":"<p>Reason in correct explanation the above Assertion.</p>"},{"question_id":"1linbel1v","chapter":"thermodynamics","chapterGroup":"physical-chemistry","difficulty":null,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","subjectGroup":null,"topic":"reactions-related-to-enthalpies-and-hesss-law","type":"mcq","isOutOfSyllabus":false,"isBonus":false,"comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"<p>Consider the following reaction :-</p>\n<p>$$2 \\mathrm{H}_2(\\mathrm{~g})+\\mathrm{O}_2(\\mathrm{~g}) \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm{H}_2 \\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{g}) \\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}} \\mathrm{H}^{\\circ}=-483.64 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\text {. }$$</p>\n<p>What is the enthalpy change for decomposition of one mole of water?
