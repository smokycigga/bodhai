Thus, $ q = 0 $.</li>\n\n<br/><li>Free expansion : In a free expansion, the gas expands into a vacuum or against zero external pressure. Since work ($ w $) is defined as the product of pressure ($ P $) and volume change ($ \\Delta V $), and since the external pressure is zero, we conclude that $ w = 0 $.</li>\n\n<br/><li>Temperature change ($ \\Delta T $) : Since work is zero and no heat is transferred, the first law of thermodynamics tells us that the change in internal energy ($ \\Delta U $) is zero as well. For an ideal gas, internal energy is a function of temperature only; thus, if the internal energy does not change, the temperature does not change. Therefore, $ \\Delta T = 0 $.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on the above points, the free expansion of an ideal gas under adiabatic conditions is characterized by no heat transfer ($ q = 0 $), no work done ($ w = 0 $), and no change in temperature ($ \\Delta T = 0 $).

When comparing the sizes of isoelectronic species, the major factor that affects their size is the nuclear charge $(\\mathrm{z})$, which is the charge of the nucleus or the number of protons in the nucleus. Here’s why:</p>\n\n<p>The more protons there are in the nucleus (higher nuclear charge), the more positively charged the nucleus is, and thus the stronger it can attract the electrons towards it. This results in a smaller radius for the species. Conversely, if there are fewer protons in the nucleus, the attraction to the electrons is weaker, leading to a larger radius. Let's compare the species given: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ (fluoride ion) has 9 protons in the nucleus and 10 electrons.</li>\n<li>$\\mathrm{Ne}$ (neon atom) has 10 protons in the nucleus and 10 electrons.</li>\n<li>$\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ (sodium ion) has 11 protons in the nucleus and 10 electrons.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Despite having the same number of electrons, the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ion will be the smallest among the three due to the higher nuclear charge of 11 protons, which attracts the same number of electrons more strongly than $\\mathrm{Ne}$ with 10 protons and $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$ with 9 protons. Hence, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ has a lower atomic radius compared to $\\mathrm{Ne}$, which in turn is smaller than $\\mathrm{F}^{-}$.</p>\n\n<p>Considering Option B (size being the same), Option C (electron-electron interaction), and Option D (principal quantum number), none of these factors are as significant as the difference in nuclear charge for isoelectronic species.</p>\n\n<p>The principal quantum number (n) is the same for all these isoelectronic species since they all have their outer electrons in the second energy level (n=2) in the ground state. Electron-electron interactions do contribute to energy levels and could affect the size slightly, but the primary and determining factor for isoelectronic species remains the nuclear charge, as it directly influences the effective nuclear charge felt by the electrons. Therefore, Option A is the best answer.</p>"},{"question_id":"lsbmamho","chapter":"basics-of-organic-chemistry","chapterGroup":"organic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"isBonus":false,"isOutOfSyllabus":false,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","topic":"electron-displacement-effect","type":"mcq","comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"Ionic reactions with organic compounds proceed through :<br/><br/>\n(A) homolytic bond cleavage<br/><br/>\n(B) heterolytic bond cleavage<br/><br/>\n(C) free radical formation<br/><br/>\n(D) primary free radical<br/><br/>\n(E) secondary free radical\n<br/><br/>\nChoose the <b>correct</b> answer from the options given below :\n","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"(A) only"},{"identifier":"B","content":"(B) only"},{"identifier":"C","content":"(C) only"},{"identifier":"D","content":"(D) and (E) only"}],"correct_options":["B"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"lsbmbcsm","chapter":"basics-of-organic-chemistry","chapterGroup":"organic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"isBonus":false,"isOutOfSyllabus":false,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","topic":"electron-displacement-effect","type":"mcq","comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"Which of the following compound will most easily be attacked by an electrophile?","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"<img src=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/fly/@width/image/6y3zli1lsbnxfte/dc7b30fb-b6a5-44bc-b824-5a3ef23b58d7/df99d320-c5a5-11ee-b548-b72f0a3d41f6/file-6y3zli1lsbnxftf.png?format=png\" data-orsrc=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/image/6y3zli1lsbnxfte/dc7b30fb-b6a5-44bc-b824-5a3ef23b58d7/df99d320-c5a5-11ee-b548-b72f0a3d41f6/file-6y3zli1lsbnxftf.png\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"max-width: 100%;height: auto;display: block;margin: 0 auto;max-height: 40vh;vertical-align: baseline\" alt=\"JEE Main 2024 (Online) 1st February Morning Shift Chemistry -

For an electrolyte like $\\mathrm{NaCl}$, which dissociates completely in very dilute solutions, the theoretical value of $i$ is approximately 2, since $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociates into $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ ions.</p><p>In real scenarios, as the concentration of the solution decreases (making the solution more dilute), the interaction between the ions decreases, allowing more complete dissociation. Therefore, for practical purposes, the van 't Hoff factor $i$ approaches its theoretical maximum value as concentration decreases. Thus, for $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ solutions of concentrations $0.1 \\mathrm{M}$, $0.01 \\mathrm{M}$, and $0.001 \\mathrm{M}$, the fact that $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociates more completely in more dilute solutions implies that $i$ increases with decreasing concentration.</p><p>Hence, the order of $i$ based on the concentration would be $\\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{A}} < \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{B}} < \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, as concentration $0.1 \\mathrm{M} > 0.01 \\mathrm{M} > 0.001 \\mathrm{M}$, respectively. Thus, option B correctly describes the order of the van 't Hoff factors for these solutions.</p>"},{"question_id":"lsbmht85","chapter":"compounds-containing-nitrogen","chapterGroup":"organic-chemistry","difficulty":null,"isBonus":false,"isOutOfSyllabus":false,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","topic":"aromatic-amines","type":"mcq","comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"Given below are two statements :<br/><br/>\n<b>Statement (I)</b> : The $\\mathrm{NH}_2$ group in Aniline is ortho and para directing and a powerful activating group.\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Statement (II)</b> : Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Craft's reaction (alkylation and acylation).<br/><br/>\nIn the light of the above statements, choose the <b>most appropriate</b> answer from the options given below :\n","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"Both Statement I and Statement II are correct"},{"identifier":"B","content":" Both Statement I and Statement II are incorrect"},{"identifier":"C","content":"Statement I is correct but Statement II is incorrect"},{"identifier":"D","content":"Statement I is incorrect but Statement II is correct"}],"correct_options":["A"],"answer":null,"explanation":null},{"question_id":"lsbmiri2","chapter":"structure-of-atom","chapterGroup":"physical-chemistry","difficulty":null,"isBonus":false,"isOutOfSyllabus":false,"marks":4,"negMarks":1,"subject":"chemistry","topic":"de-broglie-hypothesis","type":"mcq","comprehension":null,"direction":null,"content":"According to the wave-particle duality of matter by de-Broglie, which of the following graph plot presents most appropriate relationship between wavelength of electron $(\\lambda)$ and momentum of electron $(p)$ ?","options":[{"identifier":"A","content":"<img src=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/fly/@width/image/6y3zli1lsbo2nnk/7651bc54-1fbc-42d5-917e-5fc78abd800c/70b38400-c5a6-11ee-b548-b72f0a3d41f6/file-6y3zli1lsbo2nnl.png?format=png\" data-orsrc=\"https://app-content.cdn.examgoal.net/image/6y3zli1lsbo2nnk/7651bc54-1fbc-42d5-917e-5fc78abd800c/70b38400-c5a6-11ee-b548-b72f0a3d41f6/file-6y3zli1lsbo2nnl.png\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"max-width: 100%;height: auto;display: block;margin: 0 auto;max-height: 40vh;vertical-align: baseline\" alt=\"JEE Main 2024 (Online) 1st February Morning Shift Chemistry -
