This is a characteristic feature of living things and is not observed in non-living things. Reproduction ensures the continuation of a species and allows for genetic diversity through the processes of mutation and recombination.\n<br/><br/>\nWhile growth, movement, and responsiveness to touch are also features of living organisms, they are not unique to living things. For example, crystals can grow, rocks can move due to external forces, and some non-living materials can respond to touch or pressure.\n<br/><br/>\nIntersection with the environment and progressive evolution are also characteristics of living things, but they are not unique to living organisms.
