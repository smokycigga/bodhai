# ðŸ§  Intelligent JEE Main System with ChromaDB Memory

An **intelligent, memory-powered** system that learns from user performance and creates highly personalized tests. Uses ChromaDB for vector memory and MongoDB for structured data.

## What Makes This Intelligent

### ðŸ§  **Memory & Learning**
- **ChromaDB Vector Memory** - Remembers question patterns and user interactions
- **Performance Pattern Recognition** - Identifies weak topics and mistake patterns
- **Adaptive Test Generation** - Each test becomes more personalized based on history
- **Mistake Pattern Analysis** - Finds similar questions to past mistakes

### **Personalization Levels**
1. **First Test**: Random questions (no history)
2. **After 1-2 Tests**: Basic weak topic identification
3. **After 3+ Tests**: Advanced personalization with mistake patterns
4. **Ongoing**: Continuous learning and adaptation

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Intelligent System
```bash
python intelligent_jee_server.py
```

You'll see:
```
 MongoDB connected successfully
 ChromaDB initialized with intelligent memory
ðŸ§  Loading questions with intelligent vectorization...
 Loaded 1250 questions
ðŸ§  Vectorized 1250 questions for intelligent retrieval
ðŸ§  Starting Intelligent JEE Main Server on port 5001
```

### 2. Test the Intelligence
```bash
python test_intelligent_system.py
```

Expected output:
```

```

## ðŸ§  How the Intelligence Works

### **Question Selection Algorithm**
```
For each test:
 60% from weak topics (ChromaDB similarity search)
 25% from mistake patterns (vector similarity to past errors)
 15% from general coverage (maintaining breadth)
```

### **Memory Components**
1. **Vector Memory (ChromaDB)**
 - Question embeddings for similarity search
 - Topic clustering and pattern recognition
 - Mistake pattern matching

2. **Structured Memory (MongoDB)**
 - User performance history
 - Chapter/topic accuracy tracking
 - Learning velocity analysis

### **Intelligence Features**
- **Weak Topic Detection**: < 65% accuracy with â‰¥2 attempts
- **Mistake Pattern Analysis**: Finds questions similar to past errors
- **Learning Velocity**: Tracks improvement rate over time
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjusts question complexity based on performance
